# Calculator

Author: Sankalpa Paudel

This is a calculator that has a graphical user interfcae (GUI) and was developed by myself through the use of JavaScript, HTML/CSS. It is a simple calculator that has the basic arithmetic operations (such as adding, subtracting, multiplication, division). There are buttons to clear everything and to backspace as well as to add brackets to further emulate the features of a physical calculator.
